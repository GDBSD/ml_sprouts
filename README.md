## Getting Started

ML Sprouts is intended to provide machine learning "sprouts", i.e. a project you can use to select
"spouts" to transplant into your ML "garden" to "grow" a new project. Its secondary objective is to
provide a comprehensive survey of traditional machine learning methods, new deep learning tools, and
a collection of mostly toy examples using small datasets to speed things up.

Most of survey of traditional machine learning methods is extracted from the book _"Building Machine Learning
and Deep Learning Models on Google Cloud Platform"_. Note that, in general training deep learning models works
best on a GPU instance. There are multiple alternatives for setting up a remote GPU. Some are free, some you
will have to pay for, usually by the minute. Prices on services like [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com/)
are quite reasonable.

NOTE: The O'Reilly link (below), and links in the code, point to pages in an e-book on their site. The book is
also available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Machine-Learning-Models-Platform/dp/1484244699/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Building+Machine+Learning+and+Deep+Learning+Models+on+Google+Cloud+Platform&qid=1573062357&sr=8-1)

Contributing: Please create a feature branch before committing code and do a PR when you're ready to
merge into the '''develop``` branch. Delete your feature branch after the merge.

Please comment you code and, if you're writing a Python script, add docstrings.

I use Anaconda which will probably load a bunch of packages you won't need but I'm lazy. All the the packages
are listed in requirements.txt. If you find you are missing a package that's essential to running your code
please add it to requirements.txt. I strongly recommend you create a virtual environment for any project you're
working on, even this one. My virtual environment (so I don't forget) is ```ml```
