# Misc. Stuff
Collection of useful code examples and Jupyter notebooks.

Contributing: Please create a feature branch before committing code and do a PR when you're ready to
merge into the '''develop``` branch. Delete your feature branch after the merge.

Please comment you code and, if you're writing a Python script, add docstrings.

I use Anaconda which loads a bunch of packages you won't need so I'm keeping the requirements.txt file
a minimum. If you find you are missing a package that's essential to running your code please add
it to requirements.txt. I strongly recommend you create a virtual environment for any project you're
working on, even this one.
