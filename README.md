## Getting Started

Comprehensive survey of traditional machine learning methods and a collection of useful code examples
and Jupyter notebooks.

The survey of traditional machine learning methods is extracted from the book _"Building Machine Learning and
Deep Learning Models on Google Cloud Platform"_. Deep learning content is not included in this repo. In general
training deep learning models works best on a GPU instance.

NOTE: The O'Reilly link (below) is to a page in an e-book on their site. The book is also available on
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Machine-Learning-Models-Platform/dp/1484244699/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Building+Machine+Learning+and+Deep+Learning+Models+on+Google+Cloud+Platform&qid=1573062357&sr=8-1)

Contributing: Please create a feature branch before committing code and do a PR when you're ready to
merge into the '''develop``` branch. Delete your feature branch after the merge.

Please comment you code and, if you're writing a Python script, add docstrings.

I use Anaconda which will probably load a bunch of packages you won't need but I'm lazy. All the the packages
are listed in requirements.txt. Before installing

so I'm keeping the requirements.txt file
a minimum. If you find you are missing a package that's essential to running your code please add
it to requirements.txt. I strongly recommend you create a virtual environment for any project you're
working on, even this one.
